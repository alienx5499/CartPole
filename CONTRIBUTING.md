## **Project Structure**
1. **`CartPole/`**:  
   - **`CartPole.py`**: Script for rendering the trained agent and observing its performance.
   - **`CartPoleAlgorithm.py`**: Core DQN training algorithm for the CartPole-v1 environment.
   - **`Visualize_q_table.py`**: Tools to visualize training metrics like rewards, losses, and epsilon decay.
2. **`ModelData/`**:  
   - Contains the pre-trained DQN model (`cartpole_dqn_optimized.pth`) and training logs (`training_logs.json`).
   - If you prefer, you can run `CartPoleAlgorithm.py` to generate your own model and metrics.
